Responsive Web Design (RWD) Responsive web design is a web design method that enables web to fit the screens of different devices automatically, displaying the content in a way that people feel comfortable.

My site is fully responsive from widths greater than 400px.<br>

The technologies used:<br>
    HTML5<br>
    CSS<br>
    JavaScript<br>
    PHP
    
I used CSS rules like:<br>
@media that made possible to define different style rules for different media types<br>
@keyframes to create gradually changing animations<br>

I used JavaScript to create some interactions between browser and user, such as:<br>
-moving "activ button"<br>
-display popup window at the press of button and much more...

To make all these effects possible I used JavaScript:<br>
-event like: scroll, click...<br>                   
-method like: querySelector, addEventListener, getElementById, getElementsByClassName, scrollTo, etc ...

For the contact form I used PHP and the "mail" system function which has 3 mandatory parameters:<br>
-to<br>
-subject<br>
-message<br>
