Responsive Web Design (RWD) Responsive web design is a web design method that enables web to fit the screens of different devices automatically, displaying the content in a way that people feel comfortable.

My site is fully responsive from widths greater than 400px.


The technologies used:
    HTML5
    CSS
    JavaScript
    PHP
    
*I used CSS rules like @media that made possible to define different style rules for different media types
                      @keyframes to create gradually changing animations
*I used JavaScript to create some interactions between browser and user, such as:
                      -moving "activ button"
                      -display popup window at the press of button and much more...
*To make all these effects possible I used JavaScript event like: scroll, click...                   
                                                     method like: querySelector, addEventListener, getElementById,
                                                                  getElementsByClassName, scrollTo, etc ...
*For the contact form I used PHP and the "mail" system function which has 3 mandatory parameters:
                      -to
                      -subject
                      -message
